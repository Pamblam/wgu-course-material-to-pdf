# wgu-course-material-to-pdf

This was written to get a specific job done. It is not really designed as a general purpose tool, though it may be useful as a starting point for one later.

This script assumes you have not set up MFA yet and that the skip button is still available. The script may make other assumptions as well. Shouldn't be hard to adapt to other use cases later though..
